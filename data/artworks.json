    "image_description": "This installation was meant to embody a reflection on the good and bad aspects of growing up in the closet in rural Colorado. In it, i constructed a \"clubhouse\" structure inside the gallery space, made out of discarded cardboard, recycled wood, and other found materials. Outside of the structure, a clothesline is hung with the artist's own clothes. Inside, viewers may page through the artist's own catholic devotional (book of prayers), as well as world history notebook from high school. Other personal items are displayed inside a cabinet, and viewers may play Super Mario Bros on a discarded cathode ray tube television.",
